How to play:
       make and execute (gcc, c++11 needed)

       Keys:
                `[SQ][SQ]` --> Move  (e.g. `e2e4`)
                `cpu`      --> Let engine move
                `analysis  --> Analyze position
                `undo`     --> Takes back last move
                `quit`     --> Quits engine
