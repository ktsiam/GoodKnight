TODO:
          BUG: castling rights when moving rook <---

          Generate move_gen functions for:
                   - ROOKS
                   - BISHOPS
                   - QUEENS

          (rotated - reverse bitboards?)

          future: update instead of generating?
          Make this code clockwork before moving further (try kcachegrind,)
