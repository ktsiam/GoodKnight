TODO:
          Make move space-efficient (i.e. BB -> idx, pack bits)          

          Generate move_gen functions for:
                   - BISHOPS
                   - ROOKS
                   - QUEENS

          calculate occupancy incrementally!! (and other properties)

          Allow undo's 
          (rotated - reverse bitboards?)

          future: update instead of generating?
          Make this code clockwork before moving further
